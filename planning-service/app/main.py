"""The route planner: two airport idents in, a chart with the course and
its checkpoints out, plus the dead-reckoning nav log for the legs between
them.

This is the human-facing surface of everything else in the project. The
model scores candidate landmarks (model-service), vfr.checkpoints narrows
them to the handful worth flying, and vfr.navlog turns those into legs
with real wind and magnetic variation -- but none of that is inspectable
from a JSON response. Seeing the checkpoints on the sectional is the only
way to judge whether they are findable in the air, which is the question
the whole model exists to answer.

Split of responsibility, and why it falls this way:

- model-service owns the model artifact and its pinned scikit-learn, and
  stays /ping + /invocations + /routes, mirroring a SageMaker inference
  container. This service never loads a model.
- This service owns everything route-shaped: collecting a corridor,
  building its features, computing the nav log, and drawing it.

The endpoints live in app.routers, one module per concern; the work they
share -- resolving a route, scoring it, the nav-log arithmetic, the
corridor read -- is in the modules next to this one.
